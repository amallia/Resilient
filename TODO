Failable

4. Add a 'getvalueor(callable)' which lazily calls the callable if it's failure

Task

1. Use the failure detector
2. Handle functions returning void

Failures

1. Specify the types of failures so that Task can use it when constructing the failable

Job

1. provide a 'as_callable', signature like 'run', which moves the job into a lambda and returns it.

FUTURE

Use invoke instead of calling the functions
