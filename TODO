Failable

4. Add a 'getvalueor(callable)' which lazily calls the callable if it's failure
5. Create base class for deriving from boost::variant to reduce code duplication
6. Delete useless methods and only keep the few which are usefull for creating failures

Task

1. Use the failure detector
2. Handle functions returning void

Failures

0. Rewrite to call pre/post instead of fold.

Job

1. provide a 'as_callable', signature like 'run', which moves the job into a lambda and returns it.

FUTURE

Use invoke instead of calling the functions
