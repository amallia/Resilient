Failable

4. Add a 'getvalueor(callable)' which lazily calls the callable if it's failure
6. Delete useless methods and only keep the few which are usefull for creating failures

Task

1. Use the failure detector
2. Handle functions returning void

Failures


Job

1. provide a 'as_callable', signature like 'run', which moves the job into a lambda and returns it.

FUTURE

0. Put utilities into detail namespace
1. Use invoke instead of calling the functions
2. Change the OperationResult from being a variant of std::exception_ptr to use a wrapper type so that it T is exception ptr the code works anyway
