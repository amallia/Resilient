Failable

4. Add a 'getvalueor(callable)' which lazily calls the callable if it's failure

Task

1. Use the failure detector
2. Handle functions returning void

Failures

0. Rewrite to call pre/post instead of fold.
1. Rename failures to detector to not get confused with failable and failures inside failables

Job

1. provide a 'as_callable', signature like 'run', which moves the job into a lambda and returns it.

FUTURE

Use invoke instead of calling the functions
